# Bindable.Core [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/ggdsi7eek8sgfouw?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jacob-ebey/bindable)
Binding manager and interfaces for adding bindings to existing UI frameworks.

I'd love some feedback on this at [https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10144470](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10144470) as it is my first project of this type. If there is interest I will continue to expand upon this to iOS, and Windows Forms.
